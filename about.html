                ABOUT ME
            </h1>
            <p>
                I am 19 years old and currently studying at MMSU CIT, where I am pursuing a BSIT in Comtech. I have always been passionate about technology and computers, and my course helps me develop the skills I need to thrive in the ever-evolving world of information technology. I enjoy learning about new software, programming, and how digital systems work, which motivates me to stay dedicated to my studies.

One of my favorite hobbies is playing basketball. It's a sport I really enjoy because it keeps me active and allows me to unwind after a busy day. Playing basketball has also taught me valuable lessons about teamwork, perseverance, and strategic thinking. I love the excitement of the game and the camaraderie that comes with playing on a team with friends and classmates.
            <p>
               Aside from my athletic interests, I have a deep appreciation for nature. I find peace and inspiration when I spend time outdoors, whether it’s in the mountains, parks, or just exploring the natural surroundings near my home. Connecting with nature helps me relax and recharge, giving me a fresh perspective and energy to continue with my academic and personal pursuits.

Overall, I see myself as someone who balances a strong passion for technology, a love for sports, and a deep respect for the environment. I believe that combining these interests helps me grow as a person—remaining active, curious, and connected to the world around me. I’m excited about the future and eager to keep exploring new experiences and opportunities ahead.</p>
