            <h2>A Deeper Look into Pasuquin's History</h2>
            <p>The history of Pasuquin is a tapestry woven from indigenous legend, Spanish colonial influence, and the resilience of its people. The town's origin traces back to the 17th century, when it was known as "Pa-asoken," an Ilocano term derived from "pa-asok," meaning "to produce smoke." This name harks back to the days of piracy, when watchmen on Sentinella Hill would light a fire to create smoke signals, warning coastal settlers of approaching invaders from the South China Sea. Upon seeing the smoke, the community would rally to defend their shores.</p>
            <p>Spanish colonizers later established a formal parish in 1784 under Santiago Apostol, setting the course for the town's Christianization. However, Pasuquin's original inhabitants were diverse indigenous tribes. Some accounts point to the Itneg tribe, while others mention the Ibaliws, wandering people who were eventually driven from their settlement by mountain people. The vacated land became known as "Nagrebcan" (the place of the vanquished), which eventually gave way to the town's current name, Pasuquin. The original Augustinian-built church from 1730 was sadly destroyed during World War II, a traumatic period for Pasuquin, but the town has since rebuilt and regained its prosperity.</p>
