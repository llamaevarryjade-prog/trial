                In Pasuquin, Ilocos Norte, garlic (or bawang) is more than just a crop; it is the "white gold" of the region and a symbol of Ilocano culinary tradition and resilience. The municipality is a major producer of the prized Ilocos white variety, celebrated for its pungent aroma and strong, lasting flavor, which differentiates it from larger, milder imported garlic.

                The biscocho from Pasuquin is a beloved delicacy in Ilocos Norte, known for its unique flavor and soft, chewy texture. Unlike the crunchy, twice-baked versions found elsewhere in the Philippines, the Pasuquin biscocho is characteristically tender and aromatic. It is often enjoyed as a comforting snack with coffee or hot chocolate, and its reputation makes it a popular pasalubong (souvenir) for travelers.

               Dumadara is the local name for a species of tuna or bonito that is a highly valued and celebrated catch in the coastal communities of Pasuquin, particularly in Barangay Davila. This small, oily fish, known for its firm texture and rich flavor, is central to both the local diet and the town's cultural identity.

                Pasuquin is widely known as the "Salt Capital of Ilocos Norte" due to its long-standing tradition of producing high-quality sea salt, locally known as asin. This artisanal craft is a source of immense pride for the town and a significant part of its history and livelihood. The salt is distinct not only for its pure, sweet-salty flavor but also for the traditional, labor-intensive process called Panagsana.

                While the Sanskrit word lasuna refers to garlic, in the context of Pasuquin, Ilocos Norte, the term suna is used for shallots, a vital component of the town's agricultural economy. A prominent onion-like vegetable in Filipino cuisine, shallots are grown alongside garlic and other high-value crops in the Ilocos region.
